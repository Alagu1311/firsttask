OBJECTS AND REPRESENTATION
Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
